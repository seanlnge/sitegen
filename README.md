Build a website from a given Instagram handle. I will use this to charge people $100 to build them a website for their stupid Instagram photography portfolio.

All I need to do is change the `CLIENT_INSTAGRAM_HANDLE` var to the @ of the small Instagram brand and puppeteer scrapes their insta page to find their bio, posts, etc, etc, and plugs it into gpt4o asking to describe a website that this user will want. Then I take this description and feed gpt4o the template websites I have downloaded, let it choose the one that fits the brand the best. I will then feed it the template HTML and CSS and ask to alter it to fit the description that it provided earlier.

Then I spam this over 1000 small photography pages/side hustle brands and get a 10%+ success rate and get a bazillion gazillion dollars.
